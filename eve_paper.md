abstract: Adaptive gradient methods for stochastic optimization adjust the
    learning rate for each parameter locally. However, there is also a global
    learning rate which must be tuned in order to get the best performance. In
    this paper, we present a new algorithm that adapts the learning rate locally
    for each parameter separately, and also globally for all parameters
    together. Specifically, we modify Adam, a popular method for training deep
    learning models, with a coefficient that captures properties of the
    objective function. Empirically, we show that our method, which we call
    _Eve_, outperforms Adam and other popular methods in training deep neural
    networks, like convolutional neural networks for image classification, and
    recurrent neural networks for language tasks.

# Introduction {#sec:intro}
Training deep neural networks is a challenging non-convex optimization problem.
Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a simple way to move towards local optima
by following the negative (sub)gradient. However, vanilla SGD struggles with
making progress, and is insufficient for solving large-scale problems. One issue
arises from the use of a global learning rate in vanilla SGD. Due to
ill-conditioning of the optimization problems, setting this learning rate is
tricky. To prevent the loss from ``bouncing around'' or diverging in directions
with high curvature, the learning rate must be kept small. But this leads to
slow progress in directions with low curvature. In many problems, the sparsity
of gradients creates an additional challenge for SGD. Some features might occur
very infrequently, but might be very informative. Therefore, these features
should be given a large learning rate when observed.

The issues highlighted above motivate the need for adaptive learning rates that
are local to each parameter in the optimization problem. While there has been
much work in this area, here we focus on the family of methods based on the
Adagrad algorithm[@duchi2011adaptive]. These methods maintain a separate
learning rate for each parameter; and these local learning rates are made
adaptive using some variation of the sum of squared gradients. Roughly speaking,
if the gradients for some parameter have been large, its learning rate is
reduced; and if the gradients have been small, the learning rate is increased.
Variations of Adagrad such as RMSprop[@tieleman2012lecture],
Adadelta[@zeiler2012adadelta], or Adam[@kingma2014adam] are, by far, the most
popular alternatives to vanilla SGD for training deep neural networks.

In addition to parameter-specific local learning rates, the adaptive methods
described above also have a global learning rate which determines the overall
step size. In many cases, this global learning rate is left at its default
value; however, to get the best performance, it needs to be tuned, and also
adapted throughout the training process. A common strategy is to decay the
learning rate over time, which adds an additional hyperparameter, the decay
strength, that needs to be chosen carefully. In this work, we address the
problem of adapting the global learning rate with a simple method that
incorporates "feedback" from the objective function.

Our algorithm, Eve, introduces a scalar coefficient $d_t$ which is used to adapt
the global learning rate to be $\alpha_t = \alpha_1 / d_t$, where $\alpha_1$ is
the initial learning rate. $d_t$ depends on the history of stochastic objective
function evaluations, and captures two properties of its behavior: variation in
consecutive iterations and sub-optimality. Intuitively, high variations should
reduce the learning rate and high sub-optimality should increase the learning
rate. We specifically apply this idea to Adam[@kingma2014adam], a popular
method for training deep neural networks.


# Related work {#sec:relwork}
Our work builds on recent advancements in gradient based optimization methods
with locally adaptive learning rates. Notable members in this family are
Adagrad[@duchi2011adaptive], Adadelta[@zeiler2012adadelta],
RMSProp[@tieleman2012lecture], Adam (and Adamax)[@kingma2014adam]. These methods
adapt the learning rate using sum of squared gradients, an estimate of the
uncentered second moment. Some of these methods also use momentum, or running
averages instead of the raw gradient. Being first-order methods, they are simple
to implement, and computationally efficient. In practice, they perform very well
and are the methods of choice for training large neural networks.

As was discussed in the introduction, these methods have a global learning rate
which is generally constant or annealed over time. Two popular decay algorithms
are exponential decay which sets $\alpha_t = \alpha_1\exp(-\gamma t)$, and $1 /
t$ decay which sets $\alpha_t = \alpha_1 / (1 + \gamma t)$. Here $\gamma$ is the
decay strength, $t$ is iteration number, and $\alpha_1$ is the initial learning
rate. For Adam, @kingma2014adam suggest $1 / \sqrt{t}$ decay which sets
$\alpha_t = \alpha_1 / \sqrt{1 + \gamma t}$. We compare our proposed method with
Adam using these decay algorithms. There are other heuristic scheduling
algorithms used in practice like reducing the learning rate by some factor after
every some number of iterations, or reducing the learning rate when the loss on
a held out validation set stalls. @smith2017cyclical proposes a schedule where
the learning rate is varied cyclically between a range of values.

@schaul2013no takes up the more ambitious goal of completely eliminating the
learning rate parameter, with a second-order method that computes the diagonal
Hessian using the bbprop algorithm[@lecun1998efficient]. Note, however, that the
method is only applicable under mean squared error loss. Finally, for convex
optimization, @polyak1987introduction proposes a way to select step sizes for
the subgradient method when the optimum is known. It can be shown that with
steps of size $(f_t - f^\star) / \|g_t\|^2$ (where $g_t$ is a subgradient), the
subgradient method converges to the optimal value under some conditions. Our
method also makes use of the optimal value $f^\star$ for adapting the global
learning rate.


# Method {#sec:method}
## Preliminaries: Adam {#sec:method_prelim}
Since our method builds on top of the Adam algorithm, we begin with a brief
description of the method. First, we establish the notation: let $f(\theta)$ be
a stochastic objective function with parameters $\theta$, and let $\theta_t$ be
the value of the parameters after time $t$. Let $f_t = f(\theta_t)$ and $g_t =
\nabla_{\theta} f(\theta_t)$. Adam maintains a running average of the gradient
given by

$$
  m_t = \beta_1 m_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_1)g_t,
$$ {#eq:m}

with $m_0 = 0$. A correction term is applied to remove the bias caused by
initializing with 0.

$$
  \wh{m}_t = m_t / (1 - \beta_1^t).
$$ {#eq:mhat}

$\wh{m}_t$ is an unbiased estimate of the gradient's first moment assuming
stationarity ($\E{\wh{m}_t} = \E{g_t}$). A similar term is computed using the
squared gradients:

$$
\begin{aligned}
       v_t &= \beta_2 v_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_2)g_t^2. \\
  \wh{v}_t &= v_t / (1 - \beta_2^t).
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq:vvhat}

$\wh{v}_t$ is an unbiased estimate of the gradient's uncentered second moment
($\E{\wh{v}_t} = \E{g_t^2}$). Then, Adam updates parameters using the update
equation

$$
  \theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \alpha_t\frac{\wh{m}_t}{\sqrt{\wh{v}_t} + \epsilon}.
$$ {#eq:theta}

## Proposed method: Eve {#sec:method_eve}
Our method is motivated by simple intuitive arguments. Let $f$ denote the
stochastic objective function that needs to be minimized. Let $f_t$ be it's
value at iteration $t$, and let $f^\star$ be its global minimum. First, consider
the quantity $|f_t - f_{t-1}|$. This captures the variability in the objective
function i.e., how much the function is changing from one step to the other. If
this quantity is large, any particular stochastic evaluation of $f$ should be
given less "weight", and the step taken based on it should be small. So we would
like the learning rate to depend inversely on $|f_t - f_{t-1}|$. Next, consider
the quantity $f_t - f^\star$, where $f^\star$ is the expected global minimum of
$f$. This is the sub-optimality i.e., it denotes how far we are from the minimum
at time $t$. Intuitively, far from the minimum, we should take big steps to make
quick progress, and if we are close to the minimum, we should take small steps.
Hence we would like the learning rate to depend directly on $f_t - f^\star$.
Putting these two together, our method scales the learning rate by $(f_t -
f^\star) / |f_t - f_{t-1}|$:

$$
    \alpha_t
  = \frac{\alpha_1}{d_t}
  = \alpha_1\frac{f_t - f^\star}{|f_t - f_{t-1}|}.
$$ {#eq:alpha}

However, this simple method is not stable because once the loss increases, the
increase of numerator in @eq:alpha directly increases the learning rate. This
can result in the learning rate blowing up due to taking an even bigger step,
causing the numerator to further increase, and so forth. To prevent this, we
make modifications to stabilize the update rule by first replacing $f_t$ in the
numerator of @eq:alpha with $\min\{f_t, f_{t-1}\}$. This will reduce the chance
of the cycle mentioned above, by keeping the numerator at the same value if the
loss increases. In addition, we clip the term with a range parameterized by a
constant $c$ to avoid extreme values.

$$
  \wh{d}_t = \text{clip}(d_t, [1 / c, c]).
$$ {#eq:dhat}

Finally, for smoothness, we take a running average of the clipped $d_t$

$$
  \wt{d}_t = \beta_3\wt{d}_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_3)\wh{d}_t.
$$ {#eq:dtil}

The learning rate is then given by $\alpha_t = \alpha_1 / \wt{d}_t$. Thus, the
learning rate will be in the range $[\alpha_1 / c, c\alpha_1]$. Combining this
with the Adam update rule gives our complete algorithm, which we call Eve, and
is shown in @fig:alg. Below, the equations for computing $\wt{d}_t$ are
summarized. We set $\wt{d}_1 = 1$, and for $t > 1$, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
       d_t &= \frac{|f_t - f_{t-1}|}{\min\{f_t, f_{t-1}\} - f^\star}. \\
  \wh{d}_t &= \text{clip}(d_t, [1 / c, c]). \\
  \wt{d}_t &= \beta_3\wt{d}_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_3)\wh{d}_t.
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq:summ}

## Discussion of limitations {#sec:method_limitations}
One condition of our method, which can also be construed as a limitation, is
that it requires knowledge of the global minimum of the objective function
$f^\star$. However, the method still remains applicable to a large class of
problems. Particularly in deep learning, regularization is now commonly
performed indirectly with dropout[@srivastava2014dropout] or batch
normalization[@ioffe2015batch] rather than weight decay. Therefore, under mean
squared error or cross-entropy loss functions, the global minimum is simply 0.
This will be the case for all our experiments, and we show that Eve can improve
over other methods in optimizing complex, practical models.


# Experiments {#sec:exp}
Now we conduct experiments to compare Eve with other popular optimizers used for
optimizing deep learning models. We use the same hyperparameter settings (as
described in @fig:alg) for all experiments. We also conduct an experiment to
study the behavior of Eve with respect to the new hyperparameters $\beta_3$ and
$c$. For each experiment, we use the same random number seed when comparing
different methods. This ensures same weight initializations (we use the scheme
proposed by @glorot2010understanding for all experiments), and mini-batch
splits. In all experiments, we use cross-entropy as the loss function, and since
the models don't have explicit regularization, $f^\star$ is set to 0 for
training Eve.

## Training CNNs {#sec:exp_cnns}
First we compare Eve with other optimizers for training a convolutional neural
network (CNN). The optimizers we compare against are Adam, Adamax, RMSprop,
Adagrad, Adadelta, and SGD with Nesterov momentum[@nesterov1983method] (momentum
$0.9$). The learning rate was searched over $\{1\times 10^{-6}$, $5\times
10^{-6}$, $1\times 10^{-5}$, $5\times 10^{-5}$, $1\times 10^{-4}$, $5\times
10^{-4}$, $1\times 10^{-3}$, $5\times 10^{-3}$, $1\times 10^{-2}$, $5\times
10^{-2}$, $1\times 10^{-1}\}$, and the value which led to the lowest final loss
was selected for reporting results. For Adagrad, Adamax, and Adadelta, we
additionally searched over the prescribed default learning rates ($10^{-2}$,
$2\times 10^{-3}$, and $1$ respectively).

The model is a deep residual network[@he2016deep] with 16 convolutional layers.
The network is regularized with batch normalization and dropout, and contains
about 680,000 parameters, making it representative of a practical model.

@fig:trloss(a) shows the results of training this model on the CIFAR 100
dataset[@krizhevsky2009learning] for 100 epochs with a batch size of 128. We
see that Eve outperforms all other algorithms by a large margin. It quickly
surpasses other methods, and achieves a much lower final loss at the end of
training.

  or lower loss than other optimizers.](imgs/eve_paper/trloss){#fig:trloss}

\End{widefig}

## Training RNNs {#sec:exp_rnns}
We also compare our method with other optimizers for training recurrent neural
networks(RNNs). We use the same algorithms as in the previous experiment, and
the learning rate search was conducted over the same set of values.

We construct a RNN for character-level language modeling task on Penn Treebank
(PTB)[@marcus1993building]. Specifically, the model consists of a 2-layer
character-level GRU[@chung2014empirical] with hidden layers of size 256, with
0.5 dropout between layers. The sequence length is fixed to 100 characters, and
the vocabulary is kept at the original size.

The results for training this model are shown in @fig:trloss(b). Different
optimizers performed similarly on this task, with Eve achieving slightly higher
loss than Adam and Adamax.

## Comparison with decay strategies {#sec:exp_decay}
We also empirically compare Eve with three common decay policies: exponential
($\alpha_t = \alpha_1 \exp(-\gamma t)$), $1/t$ ($\alpha_t = \alpha_1 / (1 +
\gamma t)$), and $1/\sqrt{t}$ ($\alpha_t = \alpha_1 / \sqrt{1 + \gamma t}$). We
consider the same CIFAR 100 classification task described in @sec:exp_cnns,
and use the same CNN model. We applied the three decay policies to Adam, and
tuned both the initial learning rate and decay strength. Learning rate was again
searched over the same set as in the previous experiments.

For $\gamma$, we searched over a different set of values for each of the decay
policies, such that final learning rate after 100 epochs would be $\alpha_1 / k$
where $k \in \{1 \times 10^{4}, 5 \times 10^{3}, 1 \times 10^{3}, 5 \times
10^{2}, 1 \times 10^{2}, 5 \times 10^{1}, 1 \times 10^{1}, 5 \times 10^{0}\}$.

@fig:compsched(a) compares Eve with the best exponential decay, the best $1/t$
decay, and the best $1/\sqrt{t}$ decay applied to Adam. We see that using decay
closes some of the gap between the two algorithms, but Eve still shows faster
convergence. Moreover, using such a decay policy requires careful tuning of the
decay strength. As seen in @fig:compsched(b), for different decay strengths, the
performance of Adam can vary a lot. Eve can achieve similar or better
performance without tuning an additional hyperparameter.

\Begin{widefig}

![Results of comparing Eve with learning rate decay strategies. Plot (a) shows
  the best results for Adam with different decays. The final loss values are
  similar to that of Eve, but Eve converges faster, and does not require the
  tuning of an additional parameter. This can be an important factor as shown in
  plot (b). For suboptimal decay strengths, the performance of Adam varies a
  lot.](imgs/eve_paper/compsched){#fig:compsched}

\End{widefig}

## Effect of hyperparameters {#sec:exp_hyp}
In this experiment, we study the behavior of Eve with respect to the two
hyperparameters introduced over Adam: $\beta_3$ and $c$. We use the previously
presented ResNet model on CIFAR 100, and a RNN model trained for question
answering, on question 14 (picked randomly) of the bAbI-10k
dataset[@weston2015towards]. The question answering model composes two separate
GRUs (with hidden layers of size 256 each) for question sentences, and story
passages.

We trained the models using Eve with $\beta_3$ in $\{0$, $0.00001$, $0.0001$,
$0.001$, $0.01$, $0.1$, $0.3$, $0.5$, $0.7$, $0.9$, $0.99$, $0.999$, $0.9999$,
$0.99999\}$, and $c$ in $\{2$, $5$, $10$, $15$, $20$, $50$, $100\}$. For each
$(\beta_3, c)$ pair, we picked the best learning rate from the same set of
values used in previous experiments. We also used Adam with the best learning
rate chosen from the same set as Eve.

@fig:hypsearch shows the loss curves for each hyperparameter pair, and that of
Adam. The bold line in the figure is for $(\beta_3, c) = (0.999, 10)$, which are
the default values. For these particular cases, we see that for almost all
settings of the hyperparameters, Eve outperforms Adam, and the default values
lead to performance close to the best. In general, for different models and/or
tasks, not all hyperparameter settings lead to improved performance over Adam,
and we did not observe any consistent trend in the performance across
hyperparameters. However, the default values suggested in this paper
consistently lead to better performance on a variety of tasks. We also note that
the default hyperparameter values were not selected based on this experiment,
but through an informal initial search using a smaller model.

# Conclusion and Future Work
We proposed a new algorithm, Eve, for stochastic gradient-based optimization.
Our work builds on adaptive methods which maintain a separate learning rate for
each parameter, and adaptively tunes the global learning rate using feedback
from the objective function. Our algorithm is simple to implement, and is
efficient, both computationally, and in terms of memory.

Through experiments with convolutional and recurrent neural networks, we showed
that Eve outperforms other state of the art optimizers in optimizing large
neural network models. We also compared Eve with learning rate decay methods and
showed that Eve can achieve similar or better performance with far less tuning.
Finally, we studied the hyperparameters of Eve and saw that a range of choices
leads to performance improvement over Adam.

One limitation of our method is that it requires knowledge of the global
expected minimum of the objective function. One possible approach to address
this issue is to use an estimate of the minimum, and update this estimate as
training progresses. This approach has been applied successfully when using
Polyak step sizes with the subgradient method.
