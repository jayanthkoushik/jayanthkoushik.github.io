I am a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University studying computational
neuroscience and machine learning. I am advised by
[Mike Tarr](http://tarrlabwiki.cnbc.cmu.edu/index.php/Tarr) and
[Aarti Singh](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aarti/). I am interested in developing
machine learning algorithms, and using them to design neuroscience experiments.
My current research is on real-time optimization in EEG.
