I am a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University studying computational
neuroscience and machine learning. I am advised by
[Mike Tarr](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/people/core-training-faculty/tarr-michael.html) and
[Aarti Singh](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aarti/). I am interested in developing
machine learning algorithms, and using them to design neuroscience experiments.
My current research is on real-time optimization in <abbr title="electroencephalography">EEG</abbr>.
